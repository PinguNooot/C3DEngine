## What the goal of this project

- Learning the Graphics Pipeline without using Graphics API (Only using the CPU)
- Try to know the limit of the rendering part back in the PS1 and PS2 era.

## How to Use

### Librairies

- SDL2

üôå You don't need to download external librairies, all the librairies are in the repo and linked !

‚ö†Ô∏è Only work on Window OS

- Clone the repository
- Launch the Visual Studio Solution
- Build and Play in Debug

## Features

- Display 3D Object (Model or simple primitive).
- Load a texture and display to the model
- Lighting : Simple directionnal Light
- Simple Camera Movement (like a plane).
- Switch Render Parts
- Switch Meshes
- View differents part of the rendering project

### Remapping the Input

- Go to the key_mapping.c and add or change the GLFW Key

## Modify the Engine

### Add Meshes

‚ö†Ô∏è CEngine only support .obj file. For the FBX File, you need to install the FBX SDK from Autodesk and implement the logic yourself.

- Add the Model in the Assets Folder
- Open the resource.h and add the path to your(s) model(s)
- Open the main.cpp, go to the initialize_meshes() and add the Model witht the load_mesh function (obj_filename, png_filename, scale, translation, rotation)

‚úîÔ∏è For now the model and his resource are loaded but now you need to display him !

Now you have two Options : 

- You can press 0 and see all the meshes in the scene with your model appear !
- You can comment the third model and load your and press 9
‚úÖ If you follow all this step, now you have the Model display in the Engine.
